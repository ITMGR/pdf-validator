Starting and configuring monitoring Service
-------------------------------------------

PDF Validator monitoring is a simple web service that allows one to
check if the validation service is running correctly. This monitoring
service tries to periodically validate a simple PDF document using the
validator, and exposes the validation results via a JSON API. This JSON
API also includes information about TSL loading error messages that
occurred on the validation server (if any) and shows when the TSLs
(and/or their signing certificates) are about to expire. The simplest
way to run this service is to issue a command shown below.

**Run PDF validator monitoring Service**

```bash
java -jar pdf-validator-monitoring-1.0.2.RC1.jar
```

Default parameters for monitoring application are:

```
server.port=9000
monitoring.host=http://localhost:8080
monitoring.path=/pdf-validator-webapp/wService/validationService
```

**Default monitoring interval is 5 min**
```
monitoring.requestInterval=300000
```

You can override these properties by placing application.properties file
in same directory where the `pdf-validator-monitoring-1.0.2.RC1.jar` is
located.

Command line arguments
----------------------

If You do not like messing around with `application.properties` then You
can pass in configuration as command line arguments.

following command line options are available:

```bash
java -jar pdf-validator-monitoring-1.0.2.RC1.jar \
	--server.port=4500 \
	--monitoring.host=http://localhost:8080 \
	--monitoring.path=/pdf-validator-webapp/wservice/validationService \
	--monitoring.tslStatusPath=/pdf-validator-webapp/status/tsl \
	--monitoring.requestInterval=3000
```

Explanation of command line arguments:
* `--server.port` - set the port in which the monitoring service should be started
* `--monitoring.host` - URL Path to PDF Validator service
* `--monitoring.path` - path to PDF Validator validation service endpoint
* `--monitoring.tslStatusPath` - path to info about TSL state in PDF Validator
* `--monitoring.requestInterval` - how often should be checked for PDF Validator service state.
  Interval is in milliseconds.

Monitoring Service response values
----------------------------------

To see the last monitoring request result You can navigate to URL with
browser where the Service is running
i.e <http://localhost:9000/> default port for the Service is **9000**.

Otherwise if You can not use browser then issue following command with
curl:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9000 | python -m json.tool
```

	"serviceStatus": "OK",
	"statusMessage": "PDF validator service running correctly",
	"tslStatusResponse": {
		"serviceStatus": "WARNING",
